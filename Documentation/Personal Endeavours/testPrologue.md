THIS IS A FICTIONAL STORY INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS AND REAL PEOPLE

## Prologue 

20xx, 
DA NANG, VIETNAM 

It was about 5am when I woke up. About 2 hours before school started. At times like this I liked to walk to the beach to see the sunrise. I put on my sandals and I'm on my way. I'd see some old men drinking tea on their plastic chairs, some other people doing excercises, and then occasional critters and dogs that chase along the alleyways. I'd looked across at some of the old men again, and saw Uncle Lu whom resided and blended among them, and gave him my greetings.

"Morning, are you doing well?"

"Of course! Don't you have to get ready for school?" 

"Uh yeah, just taking my morning stroll, I'll see you for lunch!" I then scurried along the rough sidewalk, and before I could continue my walk, his face struck with some sort of realization.

"Hey! Tonight there will be some interesting news from your father, I think you would love to hear it!" 

"mhm, 'kay!" 

You see, my father currently resided in America, he frequently sent my half of the family some money. It made us not super-rich, but definitely more comfortable than the average Viet. He definitely felt, somewhat absent in my life, as compared to the other kids. He'd show up once per year, but then was super busy doing... things. So you could say the relationship felt kind of strained.
