# THIS IS A FICTIONAL STORY.

## Prologue 

20xx, 
DA NANG, VIETNAM 

It was about 5am when I woke up. About 2 hours before school started. At times like this I liked to walk to the beach to see the sunrise. I put on my sandals and I'm on my way. The winds blew on coconut trees lined the roads with it's shade and ominous breeze. I'd see some old men drinking tea on their plastic chairs, some other people doing excercises, and then occasional critters and dogs that chase along the alleyways.  I'd looked across at some of the old men again, and saw Uncle Lu whom resided and blended among them, and gave him my greetings.

"Morning, are you doing well?"

"Of course con! Don't you have to get ready for school?" 

"Uh yeah, just taking my morning stroll, I'll see you for lunch!" I then scurried along the rough sidewalk, and before I could continue my walk, his face struck with some sort of realization.

"Hey! Tonight there will be some interesting news from your father, I think you would love to hear it!" 

"mhm, 'kay!"

You see, my father currently resided in America, he frequently sent my half of the family some money. It made us not super-rich, but definitely more comfortable than the average Viet. He definitely felt, somewhat absent in my life, as compared to the other kids. He'd show up once per year, but then was super busy doing... things. So you could say the relationship felt kind of strained. But then I'd imagine all the nice things you'd do in America with all the money he is making. In school, all my friends described America like it was fever dream. 

Due to complications, he couldn't take me to America immediately, and throughout time, I never got to see what it was like. I saw it through the lens of social media and the internet, and some parts seemed to be crazy, but the schools and culture I found quite interesting, I guess. My mother had already grown deep ties with her land, and familial obligations made her stay, so I was stuck with her. 

Here in Vietnam, all I did was go to school, go to prepatory school, and go talk to my parents. I thought it was pretty boring. The math formulas. I was actually pretty good at it if I say so myself. It was my favorite subject since my mom, who was a math teacher, taught me when I was young. However, I felt lost in other subjects, as my teachers often scolded me for it. 

In contrast to my studies, I spent my time on other hobbies. I had grown an interest in electronics, but since my school had no dedicated club, nor did it have the people ambitious enough for it, I just scavenged whatever part was in my home and tore it apart to learn it. There are very little practical applications of our knowledge in my school. We are all of the book, and while it made some of us feel smart so that we can pass our TN THPT (university entrance exams), for me, I'm not so sure.

"Your father is giving you a chance, to move to America. Something that will change your life con!" my mom exclaimed. 

Begrudgingly, I thought about everything that has happened in my life so far has been in this country. "Texas" I thought to myself. It seems like such a unique land, although I am unsure if I will get used to meeting cowboy people. My ba had already filled out nearly all the paperwork for me to come. 

## 1/ In America 

After the 24 hours of time spent flying, I was groggy. I landed in the Dallas-Fort Worth airport and I was blown away with the amount of foreigners that were going around. It also smelled very strongly... I didn't know what it was but it was making me nauseous. Maybe I was feeling sick with how crowded everything was. 

"Ugh." I thought to myself, and my head was still spinning from the rough landing. I was trying to look for my 2 large suitcases in the bag claim area. My hands were shaking, I felt like I was going to throw up. I turn on my phone and text my dad where my gate was and I took a short rest.
