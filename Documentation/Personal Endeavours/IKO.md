## So Summer 2025 Rolls around 

and I'm working at this place called IKO Industries, particularly IKO Southwest in Hillsboro, TX. It is a kind of traveler town. Has a population of around 8788 peoples as of writing this. When people drive from DFW to Austin/San Antonio the 2 east and west parts of I-35 merge to one lane. When it does, there comes a Bucee's gas station with all sorts of various goods. And of course there is the smell of burning natural gas (yes the air quality is pretty bad over there). It's not because of the cars or the people in their diesel trucks or anything... it's because of the factory that I'm working at has a lot of boilers that utilize natural gas. 

IKO Industries makes roofing shingles that are slightly cheaper than the competition, but have lasting quality, and have gotten to the reputation of brands like Owen's Corning or GAF... In particular the IKO® Dynasty® shingles are one of the most popular type of shingle, and they are what's known as a "Class 3 impact rating", follow a bunch of ASTM standards that I have no clue about and have this thing called ArmourZone® tape which holds the shingle in place even if the fiberglass-asphalt-rock-covered shingle falls apart....

You might be wondering, why would I choose to work at a place like this? Well... I was a freshman in college trying to build my resume when this place decided to take a chance on me to see if I can contribute any skills... and I was sort of desparate... so I took the offer! I made around 23 bucks an hour. 

### The place 

I took a tour of the place and dang it smelt pretty.... interesting. It was very dusty, (mostly due to the combination of fiberglass-paper rolls, rock dust, SBS-asphalt mixtures burning, hot oil etc.). It was also plenty loud, so I often wore headphones or earbuds around the place to block out the sound. Did I mention that I also had to wear steel-toe boots? yeah that was a little uncomfortable. There seemed to be a lot of microplastics or dust in the air, but it all was within OSHA standards, so we were good (I saw this as a sign that, I would not like to work here long-term).  

### The surrounds 

After work I'd often stop by the park and walk around or go around town with my vehicle. At this time, I felt stuck, and away from society. While this place is an alright place to retire, I don't think it's a place to grow. People here don't seem to dream that often, because the dreams aren't there. Some people of Hillsboro and the surrounding towns just come to work the same job and do the same thing for the entire time. It's desolate, it's empty, and it's hopeless. The only way to connect to my family was through my phone and I was doing that often.  

### Scheduling 

Every weekend I drove back up to Dallas and did some fun things.
