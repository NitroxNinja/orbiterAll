After the 2018-2019 VEX Turning Point Season, me and a friend (Trav) came together to form a team for the upcoming 2019-2020 VEX Tower Takeover season. In hopes to change from our performance last year, the both of us took on a lot more responsibilities, such as programming, and end-to-end development of the robot. We also got rid of compartmentalization of tasks and sorta forced the both of us to learn each other's skills. 

This overall is here for bookkeeping, and keeping track of events just in case anyone is interested. I also will include some of the design philosophies in here if anyone is interested in that, since the most popular video on my channel is [my anti-tip mechanism](https://youtu.be/pniv_0oHQTo?si=9h09nxq-lZYjWDH0). One concept I will bring up here which sorta of led to the creation of that is "designing with the future in mind". What that means exactly is hard to explain, but it doesn't involve brainless CAD, but rather it involves with thinking about how one component you design influences the other. 

Take for example a drive base. You can choose to place the horizontal support bars across in an good spot and hope that the placement of your towers will be adequate to have a good lifting height, a good tray angle, and etc. Or you could take into consideration the packaging of the motors/electronics, or perhaps the CoG of the robot. All of these factors play into getting "lucky" with your design process and finding something that fits with the least amount of complications. 

## Origins and Probots

I started doing robotics in 2018, joining 6364D and a team took interest in me after knowing I was the brother of one of the members of 5408R at that time. I obiviously had a little idea of what I was doing at that time but I was blinded by wanting to build the best robot possible so I started off trying to build a flywheel, but after realizing nearly every component of our robot sucked, we stuck off trying to build something simple (a catapult). My team was shutting down nearly every idea I had for the robot so unfortunately I couldn't test it. 

That was before I realized I could just bring the robot home every other day so I can work on it. So then I did just that, and brought it home to prototype intake mechanisms, catapult mounting locations, and structural strength tests and perhaps even a DR4B. This was also a time where I learned the triangle was the strongest shape. I didn't understand it immediately, but as soon as I put it on my catapult (when it shot it oscillated and wobbled like crazy). This is because when the catapult strikes the physical stop, the hypoteneuse will go into tension as the tower goes into compression straight into the base, and I have no idea what I'm talking about but I think it's a good approximation. 

I will mention at this time, this is when I learned some of teammates get mad when they don't get to do work (even though they barely do any work during the actual work week). I took the robot home one day, and improved the build quality at a massive level, and they got pretty mad that I pretty much took everything apart and put it back together. I ain't saying this to brag about my younger self, but I was really motivated to make the robot better so that we could qualify to state. 

I remember on the winter rebuild, we were originally considering to build a DR4B, but after the 2 bar cap flipper idea came out I was like, dang we need to try this, and plus it was so much lighter weight. You see at the time, saving every pound for the robot was very essential for performance. We had the cortex microcontroller + 393 motors so that essentially means it sucks under load. There were many wires, crap and I remember quite vividly my programmer always emphasized "PLEASE NEVER UNPLUG THE WIRES" which I was like "this is bull honkey", as it made building a quality robot very difficult. He would take weeks on end to hog the bot and to put spaghetti code onto the robot.

He got mad at me one day to the point where I cried. I was carrying his a-s. 

Anyways, we went to a competition, did skills, lost the whole thing and didn't even make it to eliminations. Next competition we went to a middle school only competition, did skills (and qualified to state), but lost miserably in eliminations due to our driver's lack of awareness/disobeying of instructions. Tunnel vision and just playing with the robot instead of using it to function is what got him a lot. I'm gonna be honest you can use the excuse that "oh I had ADHD and I can't focus on driving the robot" well in that case I don't think you're suited to drive the robot, normally people with ADHD struggle to focus on one thing, however when you're brought into a point of overstimulation or "high level of sensory and cognitive stimulation", you're able to focus on the actions around the robot and almost move as if you were the robot, like a Spanish dancer of some sort. So I then came to the result that he was into the idea of being a driver, but not actually driving the robot with functionality. Oh yeah our programmer was also testing our autonomous program and our robot fell off the table, and it bent the whole lifting mechanism. 

Oh yeah I forgot to mention, our teamname was called "Probots" which I thought was pretty cheesy, but we wanted to rebrand into something more serious. 

This sort of led to me to become the driver for my team because I had something in me that wanted to control the robot and move it around. As a kid I messed with a lot of RC cars so I developed an innate sense of control and perspective as if I were the robot. I went from using tank drive (2 stick) to single-stick-right-handed arcade drive, since I enjoyed the freedom of using my left hand for whatever button needed to be pressed, since I didn't want to use the same hand to drive as I was to lift my lift up. 

Anyways towards the end, my team leader, Trav, and my mentor got a good lesson and we started replanning. We just got invited to the state championship, and we needed to fix our crap. He started off by improving the notebook, and then our talking skills. I started speaking more confidently since I knew all parts of the robot, and a little bit louder since my voice was really soft at the time. I'm not saying that quiet people can't be confident. It's just that when you are quiet, and you're in a room where there's 50+ kids screaming and robots are screeching it's best to up your voice a little bit so you sound like you know what you're doing. 

We went to the state championship, proceed to lose every match, drop our robot off the table b/c our programmer wanted to test autonomous, and then go interview, win the design award, and then leave. 

Winning that award though sorta made me feel something. All the hours of prepping and building that I have done have amounted to this. I had been blessed with the fruits of my labor at that time and I wanted to continue and push on. Even though we didn't qualify to worlds I went back home, and was like. So damn, this is what it's like to be a normal middle schooler who just goes home after school with nothing to do (of course I had band but to be honest we didn't do crap in there). 

## Initial D 

I took Trav to work with me, and then later on was suggested by my mentor to take another person, Tay. So thus we set off to build one of the best Tower Takeover robots in Texas, but not yet, as it hasn't matured yet enough/gotten to the iteration stage at this point. I'll be talking in a month-by-month format. 

### May 2019
  I started out my 2019 summer thinking about the future and what I wanted to do for the season. Immediately after the game reveal, I had already started building a base and prototyping with what designs we should do in order to win. I built a DR4B with a plunger claw, but then thought about how inefficient it was. In order to intake cubes, I would have to go up and down, one at a time for the lift. Additionally, since I was so concerned with being able to score on towers, I   realized there was only one high tower, and there really wasn't any incentive to score on it, since the lower towers were much easier to score in. 

### June 2019
  I also want to briefly mention I was in this 3 week algebra speedrun boot camp, but after getting a B I decided not to continue and quit the 3rd week to focus on building the robot. After looking at it, regardless if I did complete it, I think my academic progression transition from high school to university would've been more or less the same. This boot camp I think is pretty necessary in the plot of this story since it kinda made me focus less on school and more on robotics... which in a way made me better at school, and I started getting A's and stuff. 

I then took it apart, went to use my old DR4B, and put a 3 cube claw on it, and while it was nice, it didn't achieve the goals we wanted, which was to have a extremly good stacker. Plus later on we would find out rollers for scoring on towers was more convienient than having a claw lift up and go down into the pocket of the goal. We experimented with a drop down hook vs just a large claw, and realized both ideas were stupid 


Back to the story, so then after building that I started experimenting with building a "Goofy" robot, meaning there would be a tray with a double sided roller intake on it, and then the intake was attached to a 2-bar lift. So essentially this robot could achieve and do 99.99% of what was needed in order to win in this game. My build quality from the DR4B to the goofy degraded seriously, and it's no joke, while what I did was considered "ok" for most, I looked at it funny one day and realized this should be the final robot. My robot was too wide, and I didn't even know if it could intake cubes or not. The tray was too steep the intake wasn't low enough to touch the cubes adequately, and more. 

So then what I did was rebuild everything and start from the ground up once again. This time we sort of approached a 1727G built style and use hinges to bow out the rollers instead of having them on a screwjoint, which would flex pretty easily if there wasn't any support (non-cantilevered bar). I attached a 135 degree angle bracket and put a screwjoint on it to mount the tray. Whenever the tray went forward to score into the zone, there were tiny green wheels that hooked onto the wedge bar and would bring the whole robot forward as it scored. I say that was pretty smart of me. 

### July 2019 

July rolled around, and by this time I built a traybot, but at what cost? I didn't know how to program that's what! So Trav sent me an example program to test and trouble shoot on the robot, and it took awhile to iron all the kinks out of the system but I got the arcade drive, intake, and tray buttons to somewhat work. 

## August 2019 

On August 10th, I uploaded the 1st video ever to my channel, [TT leek](https://youtu.be/aoGzytlxNvc?si=jnCuKEtx1WH7yAKF). Some team asked if we were in Virginia (we aren't). We said "No, not right now", to imply that we would be coming to Virginia. Around this time I think I was discovering how tangential velocity works, which means that with a wheel that spins at an RPM, the edge of the wheel will always cover more distance per rotation, than the inner part of a wheel. This is b/c 2 * pi * r is the circumference and the more you decrease the radius of rotation, the less circumference you get, the more, vice versa. 

### September 2019 

I believe this was when I got inspiration to do the goofy design once more. What I learned is that you could place a boxed 3 wide c-channel on the back of your lift instead of having to place it underneath your tray. This not only saved space for the tray, but it also allowed me to lift up without having to raise the tray out of the way. This later could be developed into a cube-lock idea, where you could have multiple cubes in the tray while simultaneously lifting up. 

Getting the ideas for compression and packaging to work was a little confusing, but after getting some ideas, we stuck with a hinge design for the bowing out of our intakes, and tried to angle the rollers and tray in a way where cubes would get sucked up into the tray in a good way. 

### October 2019 

Not much happened this month besides autonomous tuning. We were quickly realizing that our current controls method sucked, and our navigation sucked even more. We were running the motors purely based if they hit a setpoint and then stopped it immedieately with an internal electric brake. A running joke in our team was made because of this, after I made a function called "rotcotmot" which I made when I was tired making autonomous functions. 

### November 2019 

We had our first competition for the season in Longview, TX. We came in expecting not to do so well, but we shocked ourselves when we triple crowned. A team asked us not to run skills b/c we would've already been qualifying to state, or to purposely lose during finals, but we responded with silence/rejected them. From here, this is when I learned, not to always trust what strangers say, b/c it might cost you a win. In VEX, it's survival of the fittest, and you mostly put the desires of your team ahead of desires of other teams. 

### December 2019 

Rebuild. Mostly shifting of towers on the outside, and lowering of the tray, so that we could perhaps get more cubes. We also tested auton during this time. One of the most stupidiest things we did was try doing divorced rollers for our intake or China Rollers. These had so little compression, that we needed to create seperate c-channel supports on the side (thus adding more weight), it also had needed for our lift to be raised up a little bit (at resting position) which raised our CoG. Of course, the divorced setup had it's advantages. First off, we would know the intake would not break often due to it not having VEX chain. We also knew that the China rollers might be better at descoring cubes, but a well-enough designed American roller could do the same. 

So we switched back to American, but 5408R stayed with a China Roller setup. They had spent nearly every meeting building, meanwhile we have spent nearly every meeting driving and practicing. This is one important lesson is that, if you are time-limited like us, every single moment you can spend with a field is important. Our brothers in 5408R did not listen to this advice and wanted to create the most effective and innovative stacker, they forget to give Danny, their driver, some practice. 

### January 2020

New year. New competitions. We went to the Hudson Mixed competition, planning to alliance with 5408R, but with a sudden turn of events, a stupid claw bot got first seed and started running it down the alliance selections. During the day, for skills we did pretty badly that time, but we nailed our interview. We didn't place too hot during the competition due to mishaps and the rigor of high school level robotics competitions, but we also didn't place too bad since we did pretty ok during qualifications. 

I went into the Hudson Mixed elims with team 22204A, where we unfortunately had to beat 5408R to prevail in the finals. It was sad for us and sad for them (5408R)
