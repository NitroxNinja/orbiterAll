# Intro 

This page serves to document the origins of the team "Dynamo" and how it kind of left a mark at my school.

After the 2018-2019 VEX Turning Point Season, me and a friend (Trav) came together to form a team for the upcoming 2019-2020 VEX Tower Takeover season. In hopes to change from our performance last year, the both of us took on a lot more responsibilities, such as programming, and end-to-end development of the robot. We also got rid of compartmentalization of tasks and sorta forced the both of us to learn each other's skills. 

This overall is here for bookkeeping, and keeping track of events just in case anyone is interested. I also will include some of the design philosophies in here if anyone is interested in that, since the most popular video on my channel is [my anti-tip mechanism](https://youtu.be/pniv_0oHQTo?si=9h09nxq-lZYjWDH0). One concept I will bring up here which sorta of led to the creation of that is "designing with the future in mind". What that means exactly is hard to explain, but it doesn't involve brainless CAD, but rather it involves with thinking about how one component you design influences the other. 

Take for example a drive base. You can choose to place the horizontal support bars across in an good spot and hope that the placement of your towers will be adequate to have a good lifting height, a good tray angle, and etc. Or you could take into consideration the packaging of the motors/electronics, or perhaps the CoG of the robot. All of these factors play into getting "lucky" with your design process and finding something that fits with the least amount of complications. 

## Origins and Probots

I started doing robotics in 2018, joining 6364D and a team took interest in me after knowing I was the brother of one of the members of 5408R at that time. I obiviously had a little idea of what I was doing at that time but I was blinded by wanting to build the best robot possible so I started off trying to build a flywheel, but after realizing nearly every component of our robot sucked, we stuck off trying to build something simple (a catapult). My team was shutting down nearly every idea I had for the robot so unfortunately I couldn't test it. 

That was before I realized I could just bring the robot home every other day so I can work on it. So then I did just that, and brought it home to prototype intake mechanisms, catapult mounting locations, and structural strength tests and perhaps even a DR4B. This was also a time where I learned the triangle was the strongest shape. I didn't understand it immediately, but as soon as I put it on my catapult (when it shot it oscillated and wobbled like crazy). This is because when the catapult strikes the physical stop, the hypoteneuse will go into tension as the tower goes into compression straight into the base, and I have no idea what I'm talking about but I think it's a good approximation. 

I will mention at this time, this is when I learned some of teammates get mad when they don't get to do work (even though they barely do any work during the actual work week). I took the robot home one day, and improved the build quality at a massive level, and they got pretty mad that I pretty much took everything apart and put it back together. I ain't saying this to brag about my younger self, but I was really motivated to make the robot better so that we could qualify to state. 

I remember on the winter rebuild, we were originally considering to build a DR4B, but after the 2 bar cap flipper idea came out I was like, dang we need to try this, and plus it was so much lighter weight. You see at the time, saving every pound for the robot was very essential for performance. We had the cortex microcontroller + 393 motors so that essentially means it sucks under load. There were many wires, crap and I remember quite vividly my programmer always emphasized "PLEASE NEVER UNPLUG THE WIRES" which I was like "this is bull honkey", as it made building a quality robot very difficult. He would take weeks on end to hog the bot and to put spaghetti code onto the robot.

He got mad at me one day to the point where I cried. I was carrying his a-s. 

Anyways, we went to a competition, did skills, lost the whole thing and didn't even make it to eliminations. Next competition we went to a middle school only competition, did skills (and qualified to state), but lost miserably in eliminations due to our driver's lack of awareness/disobeying of instructions. Tunnel vision and just playing with the robot instead of using it to function is what got him a lot. I'm gonna be honest you can use the excuse that "oh I had ADHD and I can't focus on driving the robot" well in that case I don't think you're suited to drive the robot, normally people with ADHD struggle to focus on one thing, however when you're brought into a point of overstimulation or "high level of sensory and cognitive stimulation", you're able to focus on the actions around the robot and almost move as if you were the robot, like a Spanish dancer of some sort. So I then came to the result that he was into the idea of being a driver, but not actually driving the robot with functionality. 

This sort of led to me to become the driver for my team because I had something in me that wanted to control the robot and move it around. As a kid I messed with a lot of RC cars so I developed an innate sense of control and perspective as if I were the robot. I went from using tank drive (2 stick) to single-stick-right-handed arcade drive, since I enjoyed the freedom of using my left hand for whatever button needed to be pressed, since I didn't want to use the same hand to drive as I was to lift my lift up. 

Anyways towards the end, my team leader, Trav, and my mentor got a good lesson and we started replanning. We just got invited to the state championship, and we needed to fix our crap. He started off by improving the notebook, and then our talking skills. I started speaking more confidently since I knew all parts of the robot, and a little bit louder since my voice was really soft at the time. I'm not saying that quiet people can't be confident. It's just that when you are quiet, and you're in a room where there's 50+ kids screaming and robots are screeching it's best to up your voice a little bit so you sound like you know what you're doing. 

We went to the state championship, proceed to lose every match, drop our robot off the table b/c our programmer wanted to test autonomous, and then go interview, win the design award, and then leave. 

Winning that award though sorta made me feel something. All the hours of prepping and building that I have done have amounted to this. I had been blessed with the fruits of my labor at that time and I wanted to continue and push on. Even though we didn't qualify to worlds I went back home, and was like. So damn, this is what it's like to be a normal middle schooler who just goes home after school with nothing to do (of course I had band but to be honest we didn't do crap in there). 

## Initial D 

### May 2019
  I started out my 2019 summer thinking about the future and what I wanted to do for the season. Immediately after the game reveal, I had already started building a base and prototyping with what designs we should do in order to win. I built a DR4B with a plunger claw, but then thought about how inefficient it was. In       order to intake cubes, I would have to go up and down, one at a time for the lift. Additionally, since I was so concerned with being able to score on towers, I   realized there was only one high tower, and there really wasn't any incentive to score on it, since the lower towers were much easier to score in. 

### June 2019
  I also want to briefly mention I was in this 3 week algebra speedrun boot camp, but after getting a B I decided not to continue and quit the 3rd week to focus on building the robot. After looking at it, regardless if I did complete it, I think my academic progression transition from high school to university would've been more or less the same. This boot camp I think is pretty necessary in the plot of this story since it kinda made me focus less on school and more on robotics... which in a way made me better at school, and I started getting A's and stuff. 

Back to the story, so then after building that I started experimenting with building a "Goofy" robot, meaning there would be a tray with a double sided roller intake on it, and then the intake was attached to a 2-bar lift. So essentially this robot could achieve and do 99.99% of what was needed in order to win in this game. My build quality from the DR4B to the goofy degraded seriously, and it's no joke, while what I did was considered "ok" for most, I looked at it funny one day and realized this should be the final robot. My robot was too wide, and I didn't even know if it could intake cubes or not. 

So then what I did was rebuild everything and start from the ground up once again.
