# Intro 

This page serves to document the origins of the team "Dynamo" and how it kind of left a mark at my school.

## Preface

After the 2018-2019 VEX Turning Point Season, me and a friend (Trav) came together to form a team for the upcoming 2019-2020 VEX Tower Takeover season. In hopes to change from our performance last year, the both of us took on a lot more responsibilities, such as programming, and end-to-end development of the robot. We also got rid of compartmentalization of tasks and sorta forced the both of us to learn each other's skills. 

I also want to briefly mention I was in this 3 week algebra speedrun boot camp, but after getting a B I decided not to continue and quit the 3rd week to focus on building the robot. After looking at it, regardless if I did complete it, I think my academic progression transition from high school to university would've been more or less the same. This boot camp I think is pretty necessary in the plot of this story since it kinda made me focus less on school and more on robotics... which in a way made me better at school, and I started getting A's and stuff. 

This overall is here for bookkeeping, and keeping track of events just in case anyone is interested. I also will include some of the design philosophies in here if anyone is interested in that, since the most popular video on my channel is [my anti-tip mechanism](https://youtu.be/pniv_0oHQTo?si=9h09nxq-lZYjWDH0). One concept I will bring up here which sorta of led to the creation of that is "designing with the future in mind". What that means exactly is hard to explain, but it doesn't involve brainless CAD, but rather it involves with thinking about how one component you design influences the other. 

Take for example a drive base. You can choose to place the horizontal support bars across in an good spot and hope that the placement of your towers will be adequate to have a good lifting height, a good tray angle, and etc. Or you could take into consideration the packaging of the motors/electronics, or perhaps the CoG of the robot. All of these factors play into getting "lucky" with your design process and finding something that fits with the least amount of complications. 

## Origins and Probots

I started doing robotics in 2018, joining 6364D and a team took interest in me after knowing I was the brother of one of the members of 5408R at that time. I obiviously had a little idea of what I was doing at that time but I was blinded by wanting to build the best robot possible so I started off trying to build a flywheel, but after realizing nearly every component of our robot sucked, we stuck off trying to build something simple. My team was shutting down nearly every idea I had for the robot so unfortunately I couldn't test it. 

That was before I realized I could just bring the robot home every other day so I can work on it. So then I did just that, and brought it home to prototype intake mechanisms, catapult mounting locations, and structural strength tests and perhaps even a DR4B. This was also a time where I learned the triangle was the strongest shape. I didn't understand it immediately, but as soon as I put it on my catapult (when it shot it oscillated and wobbled like crazy)
