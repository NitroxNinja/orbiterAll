# Intro 

The development of educational competition robots started with Dr.Woodie Flowers at MIT, where he made a class which later evolved to what we know as the "FIRST Robotics Competition" or FRC for short, in 1992. Later, other competitions like VEX Robotics Competition (VRC) started. 
As a result, generations of high schoolers have made robots that would compete against each other in a game that would be designed every year- each game featuring some unique challenges to score more points than the opposing alliance to win. In my yapping session, I will talk about my experiences in VRC, since I have the most expertise on that.

## Basic Rules 

There are a unique set of rules every single robot has to follow in order to compete in a competition. Here are some examples: 
- 18" x 18" x 18" size limit
- 88 watt motor limit (8 11W VEX motors)
- Sheet of plastic (polycarb, delrin, etc.) only to be from 24" x 12" sheet
- No welding, no mods to electronics
- Bunch of other stuff

## Subsystems and their Applications 

In competitive robotics, there are things we call subsystems that make up portions of a whole robot that contribute to it's function there are 
- Drivetrains. Some propulsion or wheeled-based movement to go around the field
- Intake. You need to be able to pick up random game objects in the field, so you can hopefully score points
- Scoring mechanism. Could be a catapult that shoots the objects or it could even be a lift and claw mechanism, depends on the context of the game.
- Extraneous mechanism(s). Some games may require to have a lifting mechanism, or like a unique "end-game" piece to score points, this often is known to be the "innovative factor" to robots, and varies wildly across games.
