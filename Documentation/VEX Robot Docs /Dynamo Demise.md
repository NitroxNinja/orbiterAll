# Intro 

Ok I'll be honest, there wasn't really a demise for our senior year, we did start to win less and less (thus lose more and more) competitions compared to our past, but that was mostly due to stress and figuring stuff out for college. 

Over Under was a game which featured a lot of pipes and bumps, and a soccer-net-esque goal that you can push balls into. In our level of play, drive-team members could put balls into robot to introduce to the field, which was the most unique element to this game. They would need to be shot over the pipe-bump, and then pushed into the goal which led to the development of some basic shooters. However it kind of lacked the need for a well-engineered solution, and rather the want for putting balls from one spot to another. This made VEX turn a robotics engineering competition to more of a drivers competition. It was suprising since this was one of the only times where my robot went from complicated to braindead simple, then back to well-engineered simple, yet complex. 

The only real engineering innovation started to occur when VEX got rid of the yellow caps on the tall poles, so robots can climb those and do special things. We were one such team who pursued a hanging mech that took all the mistakes from other teams and morphed something that looked cool, but not necessarily better. 

## Bull Honkey 

It was a pretty weird time for me, since Over Under was one of the most easiest games, but also that led to problems. That means teams that weren't considered good in terms of build development now had a chance to shine, since driver talent was often a matter of who had the most intuition with a video game controller and what not. So VEX had officially leveled out the competition to make it more accessible to all teams of all backgrounds to that they can be successful. This is fair, but it becomes very limited in terms of learning and building I think. 

So our robot would become very simple, but firstly...

Regardless I tried to be special by building a variety of robots. One of them involved 2 very fast RPM rollers that spun like a double flywheel and it spit balls out the robot as a drive-team member would load it in. that was terrible since I sorta started to make it look too clean and it didn't match what I wanted. 

So then I went on to build a catapult, but on a 4-bar lift. The reasoning behind this was that people could just block balls being shot, so by putting yourself high up, the opponent would also need to be high up, and that meant a lot of height and weight. I eventually begun to over complicate this by adding a Toss-Up style intake to descore things, cutting a flexwheel in half, and then figuring out the robot was so heavy that it couldn't lift itself, and then when it did, it would just do flips about the pole it was on, so then I had to put a PTO (power-takeoff), and it kept dragging, so I made the 2WR (2 way ratchet) for the first time that was toggled by a piston, pulley string, winch mechanisms...... all to realize I was trying to innovate like how I was my last year. 

I literally put a flywheel on a 4 bar just to see how it was, and people called it something... very inappropriate. It worked suprisingly well, but ergonomically it was more challenging than a capult, and the idea of having it spin up after every shot made it very inconsistent. Some catapults could function really well with enough practice and tuning... but I thought that was stooypid. 

I wanted to feel something special, but I had a burdensome feeling over my head, that maybe building complicated won't be the answer to this game. I had spent nearly all of last season in Spin Up innovating and building all the designs to be the most daring team in the Texas region, where it sorta made my engineering mindset.

Simple games need simple robots so that's what I did. 

## Driver's robot

I aimmed to make my next robot super simple in order to cope with my senioritis. I built a drivetrain, I put an intake on it, and then.. I went to sleep. I didn't know why but I just didn't feel motivated anymore to care about building a robot. The stress of year's past got to me and it was saddening. Also AP Physics C and Calc BC, but those are supposed to be the bare minimum for me.

But then something good happened, so step by step I started building the robot we would use for the next 3 months of my life. Using *kaizen* the Japanese term for continuous growth, we developed our robot, by making a good step in the right direction, everyday. I build the drivetrain, built the intake (but with flex wheels). Made a catapult that was adapted from one of my turning point designs, made a ball holder and shot it, and it kinda sucked at first. I then iterated by putting some rubber on the top and that helped transfer the momentum from the catapult arm into the ball a little better, instead of just making a lot of noise and sound.

That's a good point to bring up, and what I would like to call "catapult-noise efficiency" where it's a measure of how well a catapult performs with useful work relative to noise produced. Anyways, back to the story.
