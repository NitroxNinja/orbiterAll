# Intro 

Ok I'll be honest, there wasn't really a demise for our senior year, we did start to win less and less (thus lose more and more) competitions compared to our past, but that was mostly due to stress and figuring stuff out for college. 

Over Under was a game which featured a lot of pipes and bumps, and a soccer-net-esque goal that you can push balls into. In our level of play, drive-team members could put balls into robot to introduce to the field, which was the most unique element to this game. This made VEX turn a robotics engineering competition to more of a drivers competition. It was suprising since this was one of the only times where my robot went from complicated to braindead simple, then back to well-engineered simple, yet complex. 

The only real engineering innovation started to occur when VEX got rid of the yellow caps on the tall poles, so robots can climb those and do special things. We were one such team who pursued a hanging mech that took all the mistakes from other teams and morphed something that looked cool, but not necessarily better.

It was a pretty weird time for me, since Over Under was one of the most easiest games, but also that led to problems. That means teams that weren't considered good in terms of build development now had a chance to shine, since driver talent was often a matter of who had the most intuition with a video game controller and what not. 

Regardless I tried to be special by building a variety of robots. One of them involved 2 very fast RPM rollers that spun like a double flywheel and it spit balls out the robot as a drive-team member would load it in.
