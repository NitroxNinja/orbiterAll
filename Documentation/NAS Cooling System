Intro

A NAS or Network Attached Storage is a kind of thing I have at my house for an extrananeous storage for files if ya' know what I mean. This paired along with a remote access system can possible help us store a large amount of files. 



There are several parts to the system. Firstly, there is a Raspberry Pi 4, and then there is a sort of hat that is attached to it that has 4 solid state drives (Vulcan Z SSD) attached to it.
There is also an Arduino Uno R3 for fan control of the system, and an ESP32 for I2C/WiFi stuff going on or something. 

One of the goals of this project is to create an overly-effective cooling system to bring down the 60 degrees celcius worth of heat down to like 25-30 degrees for a standard operating temperature. 

THE PROBLEM IS the heat sync and the PCB "hat" restricts our cooling space significantly, 

Testing 

So for a proof of concept, we ran the NAS as is, without any cooling systems, and found out after about 2 minutes of running it got to a temperature of 60 degrees C. For reference, normally you do not want your PCB to melt b/c it will result in reduced performance, long-term damage and such.
