# Intro 

This document will not actually be studying comets, but rather they describe a list of school projects that I have done, feel free to explore, as most of these projects are rooted in academia, but it's a little annoying. In some projects like FSAE, it involved some politics. 

In NOVA Autonomous Car, this is where I will nerd out on the ideas of not only GNC (Guidance, Navigation, and Control), but also some of the learning steps of mechanical engineering towards a car. I honestly find my takes in an "autonomous car research club" as a mechanical engineering major pretty odd. Anyways, happy reading.
