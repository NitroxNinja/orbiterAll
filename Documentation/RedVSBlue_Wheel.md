# Intro 

RedVsBlue Wheel will be my documentary over my 2020-2021 Change Up robot, and sort of the things I was experiencing throughout the creation of this robot. This was made during the COVID-19 pandemic and sort of allowed me to innovate not in robot performance, but rather develop and show off new construction techniques that most teams did not do. Something that the 5408 Build style boasts over other build styles

## Context

Worlds was cancelled, and I was just nearing the end of 8th grade when I was discovering how PID worked, and developing my first program towards it after my main programmer couldn't make too much commitments to it. You see, our programming skills were really elementary, and not only that our understanding of mathematics was very low, compared to today. Most people would consider an understanding of a basic understanding of calculus or physics when it comes to learning controls, but obiviously I was desperate to look for a way to smoothen my team's robotic movements (which consisted of prebuilt VEX functions).

I started experimenting with lateral and turning movements after seeing many teams applications of okapilib's movement library. After a series of trial and error sitting by my robot, I finally got it to work and figured out a deployable program where my code would serve as the infrastructure to whatever programs I wanted to make in the future. 

Given the circumstances of the world at that time I had all the time to grow and learn. 
offtopic: Man I didn't remember it till now but I didn't do crap in 8th grade spring. All my teachers also got lazy or did not want to overwork themselves to prepare an fully online curriculum, so I just did some work and went to bed.

## Starting off slowly 

I had absolutely no game objects. However I remembered I still had all the parts I needed to make a robot (my middle school mentor let me use parts over the summer, plus along with my brother's old parts). You still have to note during this time I was practicing how to build with my brain, and create images in my head what the final robot might look like. 

I had built my first prototype without ever touching a game object ever. Of course it didn't have enough compression to intake an actual ball, and
