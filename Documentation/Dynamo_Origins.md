# Intro 

This page serves to document the origins of the team "Dynamo" and how it kind of left a mark at my school.

## Background 

After the 2018-2019 VEX Turning Point Season, me and a friend (Trav) came together to form a team for the upcoming 2019-2020 VEX Tower Takeover season. In hopes to change from our performance last year, the both of us took on a lot more responsibilities, such as programming, and end-to-end development of the robot. We also got rid of compartmentalization of tasks and sorta forced the both of us to learn each other's skills.
