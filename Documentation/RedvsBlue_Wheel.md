# Intro 

RedvsBlue Wheel will be my documentary over my 2020-2021 Change Up robot, and sort of the things I was experiencing throughout the creation of this robot. This was made during the COVID-19 pandemic and sort of allowed me to innovate not in robot performance, but rather develop and show off new construction techniques that most teams did not do. Something that the 5408 Build style boasts over other build styles

Also yes, I didn't just name the title of this document RedvsBlue based off competition colors, but I named it particularly after the show by Rooster Teeth. I listened to Agent Tex's theme a lot. 

## Context

Worlds was cancelled, and I was just nearing the end of 8th grade when I was discovering how PID worked, and developing my first program towards it after my main programmer couldn't make too much commitments to it. You see, our programming skills were really elementary, and not only that our understanding of mathematics was very low, compared to today. Most people would consider an understanding of a basic understanding of calculus or physics when it comes to learning controls, but obiviously I was desperate to look for a way to smoothen my team's robotic movements (which consisted of prebuilt VEX functions).

I started experimenting with lateral and turning movements after seeing many teams applications of okapilib's movement library. After a series of trial and error sitting by my robot, I finally got it to work and figured out a deployable program where my code would serve as the infrastructure to whatever programs I wanted to make in the future. 

Given the circumstances of the world at that time I had all the time to grow and learn. 
offtopic: Man I didn't remember it till now but I didn't do crap in 8th grade spring. All my teachers also got lazy or did not want to overwork themselves to prepare an fully online curriculum, so I just did some work and went to bed.

## Starting off slowly 

I had absolutely no game objects. However I remembered I still had all the parts I needed to make a robot (my middle school mentor let me use parts over the summer, plus along with my brother's old parts). You still have to note during this time I was practicing how to build with my brain, and create images in my head what the final robot might look like. 

I had built my first prototype without ever touching a game object ever. Of course it didn't have enough compression to intake an actual ball, but it was a crude concept. It consisted of a 4 bar lift that had a 1 horizontal roller at first, and then 2 vertical rollers so that I would be able to descore the balls faster than I had been. It looks something like this: 

I then got introduced to the idea of a snailbot (I think by a team called 210Y, they're from Canada), and thought it was really stupid, but after seeing how the meta was shifting, my opinion was sort of invalidated, and I had to shift towards there. I thought it was ugly, but then I realized (slowly) it was an opportunity to make it look clean and cool. At this time I sorta started getting into photography as one of my new hobbies. I got into aesthetics and really developed the 5408 build style, something that was set apart our construction and quality to others. This is not to say that every part of how we build is *just for function* but it was also for the eyes as well. 

## Struggling how to think

Anyways, I went on to build a couple more prototypes (no motors of course). I experimented with building snailbots with a 3 ball capacity and a Tower-Takeover-esque roller setup, and realized it was way too high for how the game objects were (I learned this when I got the game objects from my teammate, he picked them up from Greenville!). I then dropped the intake way down low, and stuck with a single roller, b/c I thought about how the motor would fit in the goal etc. I also put a rubber tank-tread wheel, and that sucked b/c it didn't grip the ball that good.. it just sorta rolled the ball out instead of a spitting motion. From there I was experimenting with high capacity robots b/c I thought that would be the meta... turns out I was wrong. 

From then on my robot started to shape into something neat and sorta working. But  was missing something. It was missing something big. 

## A stroke of genius 

VEXU team YNOT released their robot and it had some big wheels. Like I'm talkin' 5"-6"it wheels. I sorta got inspired, and wanted to make something similar b/c a larger wheel would mean more velocity for a ball as it shot (without having to gear up). 

So then what I did was I got 2 Turning Point flags, found one of those chicken boullion seasoning cups, took the lid off and used it as a stencil. I marked it up with sharpie and painstakingly cut up the 2 flags into 2 circles. I then aligned it and drilled a hole in the center, and then used math and my eyes to drill 8 holes around the edge of each lexan circle, so that I could put 8 rubber bands across the 2 circles. I put it together an realized the circles were bending and deflecting like crazy. 

Then I got a stroke of genius. What if I use a normal sprocket and wrap chain around it to support the edge so that the lexan caves in less. And then I did that, and drilled more holes into the lexan and it actually worked.
